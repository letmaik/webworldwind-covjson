TODO:

1) need to link both UIs. So it creates one layer when with constraints for
    time and depth rather then it subsetting time and then depth.

Completed:

- Extract and load values for different
  time scales.

- Refractored to separate out the different logic of the time UI and
  legend into different classes.

- Tablet friendly

- prettify legend with boarder plus other css modifications.

- Created a managing class for sorting though multiple UIs.

- create UI for different verticle axis.
